# Bipsync Cardiff: Onboarding Checklist Web Application

As part of my **second year at Cardiff University**, a team of four of us collaborated to develop a **web-based onboarding checklist** for the company **BipSync Cardiff**, a user-friendly tool designed to help new employees navigate their first tasks using a structured checklist format.

## Overview

This **Java Spring Boot web application** supports full **CRUD operations** and was built using:

- **Backend:** Spring Boot (Java), MySQL (MariaDB)  
- **Frontend:** Thymeleaf, JavaScript, HTML/CSS  
- **Database Setup:** `schema.sql` and `data.sql`  
- **Testing:** Test-Driven Development (TDD)  
- **Version Control:** Originally GitLab (later migrated to GitHub)

Gherkin-style acceptance criteria were used to create issues, which followed the **“Given, When, Then”** format.  
Each test class was written using **TDD** to demonstrate that these criteria were met.

## Features

- Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) functionality  
- Dynamic front-end with Thymeleaf templates  
- RESTful API integration for backend logic  
- User-friendly task checklist interface

## Agile Methodology

Throughout development, we applied **Agile methodologies and principles**, aligning closely with the **Agile Manifesto**.

Our workflow included:

- Weekly sprints (planning, backlog refinement, sprint reviews, retrospectives)  
- Daily stand-ups to maintain progress and communication  
- Client sprint reviews with BipSync for iterative feedback  
- Kanban-style board for task management using GitLab issues  
- User stories and story points estimated through planning poker  
- Niko Niko calendar to track team morale  
- Stop/Start/Continue retrospectives to improve workflow  
- Definitions of Done and Ready to maintain quality  
- Team working agreement to encourage accountability and collaboration

## Outcome

This project provided practical experience in:

- Applying Agile software development principles in a real-world setting  
- Collaborating effectively within a multidisciplinary team  
- Implementing TDD and Gherkin-based acceptance testing  
- Building a complete full-stack Java web application with Spring Boot
